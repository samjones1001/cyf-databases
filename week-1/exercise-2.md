# Exercise 2

*Scenario:* You've been hired to create a database for a new company which wants to revolutionize the hotel booking market. The first task you've been given is to model how the company would store its data in a database. Here are your requirements:

- The company wants to store in the database all the hotels available on their website
- For each hotel, the company wants to record the name and the number of rooms. Also each hotel can have several room types and each room type has a specific price.
- The company also needs to store the information of customers who registered on their website with a name, an email and an address.
- Customers need to be able to record their bank details which consist of an account number and a sort code. Each customer can register several bank accounts if they want.
- Finally, as customers can book a room in an hotel starting on a specific date for a specific number of nights, the company wants to store the bookings.

With mentors help, model the database for this company. In particular, show the different tables, columns and relationships between each table.
