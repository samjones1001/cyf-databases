# Exercise 4

- Add the PUT endpoint /customers/:customerId and verify you can update a customer email using Postman.
- Add validation for the email before updating the customer record in the database. If the email is empty, return an error message.
- Add the possibility to also update the address, the city, the postcode and the country of a customer. Be aware that if you want to update the city only for example, the other fields should not be changed!
