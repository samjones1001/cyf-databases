# Exercise 5

- Add the DELETE endpoint /customers/:customerId above and verify you can delete a customer along their bookings with Postman.
- Add a new DELETE endpoint /hotels/:hotelId to delete a specific hotel.

*Note:* A hotel can only be deleted if it doesn't appear in any of the customers' bookings! Make sure you add the corresponding validation before you try to delete a hotel.
